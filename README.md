# Development Environment

This project allows you to create development environments, complete and isolated from the host operating system, using Docker as a virtualization platform, and Visual Studio Code as an IDE.

In this first version, only the settings for a java development environment will be included.

In the next versions, a way to create environments for other languages will be implemented.

Upcoming development environments:

- NodeJS with TypeScript
